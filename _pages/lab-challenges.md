# Lab Challenges

---

## Lab 1: Introduction to Network Traffic Analysis

**Problem Statement:**  
Learned to monitor and examine network traffic to establish normal patterns, detect anomalies, and respond to potential threats using tools like Wireshark, TShark, and tcpdump.

**Approach:**  
Captured network packets, applied filters, analyzed protocols (HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, SMB), and established traffic baselines.

**Tools Used:**  
Wireshark, TShark, tcpdump

**Key Lessons Learned:**  
- Importance of traffic baselining for anomaly detection  
- How to use packet capture tools effectively  
- Recognizing suspicious traffic patterns

## Lab 2: Tcpdump Fundamentals

**Problem Statement:**  
Master tcpdump command line packet capture and filtering fundamentals to analyze network traffic efficiently.

**Approach:**  
Used tcpdump with various switches for capturing, reading, and filtering traffic. Focused on verbosity, sequence numbers, and host filtering.

**Tools Used:**  
tcpdump

**Key Lessons Learned:**  
- Tcpdump command structure and syntax  
- Writing capture files and reading from them  
- Applying filters to isolate traffic of interest

## Lab 3: Analysis in Wireshark

**Problem Statement:**  
Deep dive into Wireshark for detailed packet analysis and identifying suspicious behavior within network captures.

**Approach:**  
Explored capture and display filters, followed TCP streams, used plugin tabs for metadata and expert info, and extracted files from traffic.

**Tools Used:**  
Wireshark, TShark

**Key Lessons Learned:**  
- Effective use of filters for traffic interrogation  
- Following streams to reconstruct conversations  
- Extracting files from protocols like HTTP and FTP

## Lab 4: Decrypting RDP Connections

**Problem Statement:**  
Analyzed Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) connections to understand user activity and session initiation.

**Approach:**  
Used Wireshark to decrypt RDP traffic, identify user accounts, and analyze session initiation details.

**Tools Used:**  
Wireshark

**Key Lessons Learned:**  
- Understanding encrypted session analysis  
- Recognizing user authentication in RDP  
- Practical use of decryption techniques in network forensics
